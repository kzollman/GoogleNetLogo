This project is a collection of shell scripts to assist in using Google Compute Engine cloud computing to run NetLogo BehaviorSpace experiments.

The goal is to build out a collection of scripts in order to serve a variety of functions, but at the moment this project just consists of one script (and a recovery script) in the single-run-script directory.

For more information about NetLogo please look at https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/ and for Google Compute https://cloud.google.com/compute
